I know that some of you are stilling adjusting to be back at school

But I'm here today because I have something important to discuss with you
I'm here because I want talk about your education what's expected all of you in this school new year

I'v given a lot of speeches about education,and talked about responsibilities a lot.

I'v talked about teacher's responsibilities for inspiring students and push you to learn

I'v talked about parent's responsibilities for making sure you stay on track and you get your homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of TV with the XBox

I'v talked about government's responsibilities for setting high standards and support teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working, where students aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve
