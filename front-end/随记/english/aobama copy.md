I know that some of you are still adjusting to being back at school

But I'm here today because I have something important to discuss with you

I'm here because I want to talk with you about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year

Now, I've given a lot of speeches about education.And I've talked about responsibility a lot.

I've talked about teachers' responsibility for inspiring student and push you to learn

I've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you get your homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with the Xbox.

I've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards, and supporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working,where students aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve.

But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, the best schools in the world -- and none of it will make a difference, none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities, unless you show up those schools
